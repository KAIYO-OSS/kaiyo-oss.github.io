                                the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed

                            <h4>Dispute resolution</h4>
                            <h5>Binding arbitration</h5>
                            <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute
                                (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by
                                binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO
                                SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under
                                the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where
                                appropriate, the AAAâs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer
                                Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees
                                and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and,
                                where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in
                                person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a
                                decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either
                                Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the
                                arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or
                                applicable law, the arbitration will take place in United States County, Delaware. Except as
                                otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
                                proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the
                                award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
                            <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be
                                commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in United States County,
                                Delaware, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal
                                jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state
                                and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
                                International Sale of Goods and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA)
                                are excluded from these Terms of Use.</p>
                            <p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be
                                commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is
                                found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
                                falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such
                                Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
                                jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
                                court.</p>
                            <h5>Restrictions</h5>
                            <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
                                individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with
                                any other proceedingÍ¾ (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on
                                a classÂ­action basis or to utilize class action proceduresÍ¾ and (c) there is no right or
                                authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
                                the general public or any other persons.</p>
                            <h5>Exceptions to arbitration</h5>
                            <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions
                                concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
                                concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a PartyÍ¾ (b) any
                                Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
                                unauthorized useÍ¾ and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
                                illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling
                                within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
                                shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
                                jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
                                court.</p>
                            <h4>Corrections</h4>
